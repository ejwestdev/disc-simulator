# Disk Scheduling Algorithms and Address Calculations
This repository contains Java programs that implement disk scheduling algorithms and perform address calculations for virtual memory and hard disk systems. The first program calculates the page number and offset of a virtual address. 

The second program calculates the cylinder number track number and sector offset of a logical block number in a virtual disk system.

The third program  implements disk scheduling algorithms to measure the head movement of a disk. The program includes three disk scheduling algorithms: FCFS (First-Come, First-Served), SCAN, and CSCAN.
